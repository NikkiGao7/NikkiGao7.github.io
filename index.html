    </h1>
    <p>
      In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to Mental Health. 
      This is because of rising numbers of people--young and old--who are facing mental health struggles. 
      What is mental health, and why is it important? What are its effects on us? 
      and what are some examples of mental health in our day-to-day lives? 
      This website serves as a place to learn more about mental health.

         What is Mental Health?

      <p>
          According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/index.htm">CDC</a>, 
          "Mental health is the state of your emotional, social, and psychological well-being. 
          Your mental health typically correlates with what is happening around you, and the 
          way you perceive it."

         Why is Mental Health Important?
      </h2> 
      <p>
        In the last decade, we've seen a steady decline in our mental health across all ages.
        Most recently, the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have penned a statement declaring cildren and adolescent mental health a National Emergency.
        From their declaration, they write that "this worsening crisis in child and adolescent mental health is inextricably tied to the stress brought on by COVID-19 and the ongoing struggle for racial justice and represents an acceleration of trends observed prior to 2020."
        Because of current events, we believe that Mental Health is especially important to understand.
