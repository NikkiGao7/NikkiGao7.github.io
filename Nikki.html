       Mental Health/Illness Awareness in the U.S 
  </h1>
    <p id=p1>
      Mental health impacts everyone in many ways, thus being aware of it is
      significant. Mental health affects how people cope with stress, their 
      ability to connect with others and make healthy decisions. An individual’s
      mental health can also impact their physical health as well; those with 
      poor mental health are more likely to have heart attacks, strokes, chronic 
      diseases, sleeping and smoking problems. In addition, poor mental health can 
      lead to mental illnesses. Fortunately, being aware of mental well-being can 
      help. Awareness can assist someone to understand their mental needs, which 
      then allows them to take actions before their issues grows worse.

    Mental Illness 
  </h3>
    <p id=p2>
       With about 1 in 5 Americans experiencing a mental illness each year, 
      mental illnesses are some of the most frequently occurring health 
      conditions in the U.S. However, over 50% of the people struggling 
      with mental disorders do not receive treatment or reach out for 
      assistance. Avoiding help is often a result of the stigma associated with
      mental illnesses: many people who are diagnosed with mental disorders face 
      prejudice, discrimination, and shame that lead to further suffering because
      of their disorders. This stigma commonly originates from a lack of accurate
      knowledge on mental illnesses. According to MentalHelp.net, “...the average
      person considers himself or herself only slightly informed about mental 
      illness.” If more awareness was brought on these health conditions, the 
      ostracism and unjust treatment faced by the diagnosed could be suppressed, 
      guiding more people to receive help.
