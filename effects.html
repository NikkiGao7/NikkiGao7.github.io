        Why is mental health important?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is an extremely important health aspect especially in youth 
        and teens, because it affects growth and development in adolescence and it affects 
        behaviors and habits in teens and young adults. Having mental challenges can affect 
        many parts of your life and lead to struggles that you might not even realize is caused 
        by mental health. Treating your mental health is just as important as your physical 
        health and if unaddressed as a teen, these issues can be passed into your adulthood.

        Adolescence is a time for developing and growing in many ways. In our
        youth, we develop patterns, habits, and skills that we carry on for
        the rest of our lives. Having mental health problems/disorders can
        interrupt growth and cause many problems with decision making,
        physical health, and school. According to World Health Organization,
        “An estimated 10-20% of adolescents globally experience mental health
        conditions, yet these remain underdiagnosed and undertreated”. Health
        habits are established in youth as well, and having a mental health
        problem increases risk in drug use, experiencing violence, and sexual
        behaviors that can lead to STDs or an unintended pregnancies. These
        habits will continue into adult years, which is why it is very
        important for adolescents to pay attention to mental health.

      <p>
        It is common in teenage years to experience a mental health
        challenge and if untreated, will affect development and adulthood.
        50% of mental health problems are established by age 14. Teens gain
        social skills, a sense of identity, and independence as they
        develop, but this development can become more complicated with a
        mental health issue. According to the Mental Health First Aid
        curriculum, “one in five teens has had a serious mental health
        disorder at some point in their life.” Some effects can last into
        adulthood and can possibly affect one’s whole life.
